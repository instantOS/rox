ROX-Filer
=========
A RISC OS-like filer for X
by Thomas Leonard



Quick start
-----------
If you downloaded a source or binary tarball directly, type this ($ is the
shell prompt):

	$ ./ROX-Filer/AppRun

This will compile the filer (if necessary) and then run it.

However, it is more common to use Zero Install or a distribution package. To
get the filer using Zero Install, do:

$ 0alias rox http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/ROX-Filer
$ rox
